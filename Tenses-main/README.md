# Tense Detector using NLP

## 📜 Overview
The **Tense Detector** is a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that detects the tense (past, present, future) of any given sentence. Built using Python, **NLTK**, and regular expressions, this project leverages rule-based grammar analysis to determine the tense of a sentence based on verb forms.

It’s an excellent project for learning and exploring how NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and linguistic grammar rules can be used to solve real-world language problems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** - Primary language used for the implementation.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** - For tokenization, POS tagging, and other NLP tasks.
- **Regular Expressions** - For pattern matching and verb tense identification.
- **Linguistic Grammar Rules** - Rule-based approach to detect tenses.

## 🎯 Features

- **Tense Detection**: Detects the tense of a given sentence: **past, present, or future**.
- **Tokenization**: Breaks sentences into words for detailed analysis.
- **POS Tagging**: Identifies parts of speech (e.g., verbs) crucial for tense detection.
- **Grammar-based Rules**: A set of predefined rules to determine the tense based on verb forms.
